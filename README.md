# 🧬 CombPhage: Recombinatorial Phage Engineering

**CombPhage** is an pipeline for designing recombinatorial phage engineering experiments.
**NOTE: This repository contains the beta, CLI-only version of the comphage pipeline.** 
For current GUI-enabled version please see: https://github.com/reaganman/CombPhage

---

## 🚀 Overview

Combphage can be used for designing interchangeable genome fragments wigth shared overlaps from related phage genomes.  

The pipeline currently requires a **combined FASTA file** containing the complete genome sequences of related phages, and a minimum overlap length.

## Installing and Running Combphage
1. **Setup**
   The following dependecies are required...
   
2. **Running Combphage**
   From the cloned CombPhage directory, run the following command with the path to your input fasta containing the related phage genomes, the path to the pharokka databases, and the desired minimum overlap size.

   bash find_assembly_overlaps.sh -i <fasta_path> -d <pharokka_DBS_path> -s <min_overlap>

   The find_assembly_overlaps.sh script produces the following outputs

   - filtered_overlaps.tsv -> filtered overlaps for each CDS cluster
   - cluster_overlap_summary.tsv -> raw overlaps for each CDS cluster
   - cluster_membership.tsv -> maps cluster ids to CDS members
   - pharokka_results/ -> directory with results from running pharokka
   - mmseqs/ -> directory with mmseqs results
   - lovis4u/
   - lovis4u_overlaps/ -> directory with CDS maps color-coded by regions containing candidate overlaps
  
   After the candidate overlaps have been identidied, the researcher can design assemblies visually by inspecting the lovis_overlaps genome maps and filtered_overlaps.tsv, or use the Scripts/suggest_overlaps.py script which selects an optimized set of overlaps prioritizing overlap length and similar size of resulting fragments. suggest_overlaps.py
produces tsv files detailing the top 3 overlaps sets.

One of the output TSVs from the previous script can then be used with Scripts/extract_fragments.py to create fasta files corresponding to the different framents and possible chimeras that they can be used to construct. 

## 🧩 Workflow

The CombPhage workflow is as follows:

1. **Call Coding Sequences (CDSs)**  
   Identify putative coding regions across all input genomes using pharokka and assign each to PHROG categrory with mmseqs2 where possible.

2. **Cluster Homologous CDSs**  
   Group homologous CDSs using mmseqs2 with **--cluster-mode 0 --cov-mode 1 -c 0.8 -s 7.5 --min-seq-id 0.25**

3. **Identify Candidate Overlaps**  
   Detect potential overlaps within CDS clusters.  
   Overlaps must include a **start** or **stop codon**.

4. **Filter/Optimize Candidate Overlaps**  
   Remove repetatve and low GC sequences and those smaller that the size threshold.

5. **Make output diagram**
   Color code CDSs with suitable overlaps containing start or stop codons
